## üö® Known Issues / TODO

### Known Limitations:
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Load Model functionality**: Button exists but needs wiring to TransferLearningHelper
   - Currently shows toast but doesn't actually load model weights
   - Need to implement callback from MainActivity ‚Üí CameraFragment

2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Save Model button**: Need to add explicit "Save Model" button in CameraFragment
   - Currently ModelManager can list models but no UI to trigger save
   - Recommend adding button near "Train Model" button

### Future Improvements:
1. Add "Save Model" button in camera UI
2. Wire up "Load Model" to actually restore weights
3. Show loading indicator during model load
4. Add model accuracy to card display
5. Implement sample gallery backend
